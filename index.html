<H2>Academic Background</H2>
Xinghui Zhong received her B.S. degree in Mathematics from the <A
href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</A> in 2007. In 2012 she received her Ph.D degree from the <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu/">Division of Applied Mathematics</a> of </span></span><a
href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/shu/">Chi-Wang Shu</a>. She then spent
three years at the <a href="https://math.msu.edu/">Department
of Mathematics</a>
in <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a> and one year at the <a
href="https://sci.utah.edu/">Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute </a> of <a
href="https://www.utah.edu/">The University of Utah</a> as a postdoctoral fellow. Since
2016, she has been with the <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/">School
of Mathematical Sciences</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> as a Special-Termed Professor (2016-2022), and Associate Professor (2023- ). She works in the area of
numerical analysis, scientific computing, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning.
Her research is focused on the design, analysis and applications of accurate
and efficient numerical methods for partial differential equations in various
applications.
